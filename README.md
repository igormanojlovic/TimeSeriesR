The TimeSeriesR script was utilized to simplify implementation and to facilitate replicability of the case study performed in "Time series grouping algorithm for load pattern recognition" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2019.07.009).

The TimeSeriesR script can be executed from an integrated development enviroment for R language or it can be called from Command Prompt. To get more information on parameters that can be passed from Command Prompt to the TimeSeriesR script, please install Microsoft R client and then execute the following command from Command Prompt:

"C:\Program Files\Microsoft\R Client\R_SERVER\bin\x64\Rscript.exe" "full path to the TimeSeriesR script"
